# Covid Mask Adapter
When the Covid-19 pandemic broke out I printed [Montana Masks](https://www.makethemasks.com/) for my family. I wasn't trying to make them
medical grade, but just something a little better than the bandanas available at the time.

Unfortunately the primary feedback I got back was a difficulty in getting enough breath. This was due to the Montana Mask focusing on
making far more masks from a limited supply of N-95 face masks by slicing the N-95 masks and using small sections as filters.

I didn't have that problem - as this was just intended for casual use I was using shop towels. They aren't as effective as N-95, but they
do appear to be 2-to-3x better than cotton according to some studies.

As such I chose to design an adapter that can be stuck to the front of the Montana Mask and provides about 2x the surface area for air to
get through the filter.

I downloaded the original Montana Mask around April 2nd 2020, and designed this adapter about two weeks later. The Montana Mask may have
undergone some revisions and improvements since then and might not be compatible.

# Legalese
This is something I did for my family, but I've had numerous requests to share the designs. I don't warranty anything and there's an
accompanying license file in this repository which says as much. Please don't try suing me because you think this is anything medically 
professional.
